DESCRIPTION:
    This is a program I wrote as an interface between a desktop (or laptop) linux machine
    and a Parrot Anafi drone. The design goals for it were quite simple: the interface should
    be intuitive, the GUI should be aesthetically pleasing, and a user should be able to use
    this script with little or no prior training. I also reasoned that the program should be
    appropriate for all skill levels and include information experienced pilots would enjoy,
    such as battery voltage and positional data.

KEYBINDS:
    W               - move forward (pitch fwd)
    S               - move back (pitch aft)
    A               - move left (roll left)
    D               - move right (roll right)
    
    LEFT CONTROL    - descend (decrease altitude)
    LEFT SHIFT      - ascend (increase altitude)

    Q               - turn left (yaw left)
    E               - turn right (yaw right)

    T               - takeoff/land

    ESC             - open menu
